Q001,Why do healthcare service calls with repeated login failures escalate to a supervisor request?,Causal Explanation,"Repeated failed attempts to resolve the mobile-app login issue over three weeks caused mounting customer frustration. Agent responses lacked technical depth and offered only generic troubleshooting, which increased customer anger (turns 5-9). The causal chain is: repetition -> customer_anger -> escalation. Evidence: Turn 6 (Customer): 'I've called three times about this already and nothing is fixed.' Turn 8 (Customer): 'I want to speak to a supervisor.'",Task 1 initial query; tests causal-chain extraction from Healthcare Services domain with Escalation - Repeated Service Failures intent.
Q002,Which specific agent responses in those healthcare escalation calls contributed most to the customer's decision to escalate?,Follow-up Reasoning,"The agent's Turn 5 response ('Let me reset your password again') was a repetition of a previously failed fix, scoring high on discourse_denial and low on agent_response_quality. Turn 7 ('I understand your frustration, but our system is experiencing issues') combined an apology with a denial, further eroding trust. These turns have the highest causal contribution to the escalation outcome based on the discourse graph edge weights.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 1; tests context retention and deeper evidence drill-down within the same causal analysis.
Q003,"If the agent had provided a working solution at Turn 5 instead of repeating the same troubleshooting step, would the escalation still have occurred?",Counterfactual Reasoning,"Counterfactual analysis with intervention do(repetition=0) at Turn 5 estimates the escalation probability would drop from 0.87 to 0.31. The causal model shows that eliminating repetition breaks the repetition -> customer_anger link, reducing anger below the escalation threshold. However, the pre-existing frustration from prior calls (Turns 1-4) means some residual escalation risk remains.",Task 2 follow-up to Queries 1-2; tests counterfactual reasoning with prior context dependency.
Q004,What conversational patterns in banking fraud-alert calls lead to successful resolution versus further escalation?,Causal Explanation,"Resolved fraud-alert calls show a pattern of: prompt card cancellation (Turn 2-3), clear communication of next steps (Turn 4), and proactive reversal of unauthorized charges. Escalated calls exhibit agent delays in initiating the cancellation process (discourse_delay score > 0.6), repeated transfers between departments, and lack of definitive resolution timelines. The ATE of delay on escalation is 0.34 (95% CI: [0.21, 0.47]).",Task 1 initial query; tests cross-conversation pattern analysis in Banking & Finance domain with Fraud Alert Investigation intent.
Q005,Show me the evidence turns from the fraud-alert calls where agent delay was highest.,Evidence Retrieval,"Top evidence turns for high delay: [Turn 4, Call 1846-5500] (Agent): 'I need to transfer you to our fraud department, please hold' (delay=0.82). [Turn 7, Call 1616-8531] (Agent): 'The reversal process takes 5-7 business days' (delay=0.75). [Turn 3, Call 1846-5500] (Agent): 'Let me check with my supervisor about the cancellation process' (delay=0.71). These turns correspond to the highest discourse_delay scores across the fraud-alert corpus.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 4; tests evidence retrieval with reference to specific Call IDs (ID Recall).
Q006,Are the delay patterns in fraud-alert calls also present in insurance fraud investigations?,Cross-Domain Comparison,"Yes, insurance fraud-alert calls show similar delay patterns but with higher severity. The average discourse_delay score is 0.68 in insurance versus 0.52 in banking. Insurance calls additionally show a confounding factor: claim verification requirements (discourse_clarification=0.74) that structurally introduce delays. The causal effect of delay on escalation is stronger in insurance (ATE=0.41) than banking (ATE=0.34), suggesting the combined delay-clarification pathway amplifies frustration.",Task 2 follow-up to Queries 4-5; tests cross-domain reasoning while maintaining context from prior banking analysis.
Q007,Why do some e-commerce delivery investigation calls result in customer complaints even when the agent offers a replacement?,Causal Explanation,"Even when replacements are offered, complaints arise when: (1) the agent delays acknowledging the missing delivery (discourse_delay in Turns 1-3 > 0.5), (2) the customer must repeat their order details multiple times (repetition > 0.6), or (3) the replacement timeline exceeds customer expectations. The causal chain is: delay -> customer_anger and repetition -> customer_anger -> complaint. Evidence: Turn 4 (Customer): 'I already gave you my order number twice.' Turn 8: 'Two to three business days is too long.'",Task 1 initial query; tests nuanced causal reasoning where surface-level resolution masks deeper frustration factors.
Q008,"In those delivery investigation calls, does the agent's tone shift after the customer expresses frustration?",Follow-up Reasoning,"Yes, discourse analysis shows a measurable shift. Pre-frustration agent turns average discourse_apology=0.15 and discourse_promise=0.20. Post-frustration (after customer anger > 0.5), agent turns shift to discourse_apology=0.62 and discourse_promise=0.71. However, this reactive apology pattern correlates with lower resolution satisfaction (r=-0.34), suggesting customers perceive late apologies as insincere. The causal model indicates proactive empathy in early turns reduces complaint probability by 28%.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 7; tests temporal discourse pattern analysis and context-dependent causal reasoning.
Q009,What causes telecom service-interruption calls to escalate more frequently than other call types?,Causal Explanation,"Telecom service-interruption calls have a 3.2x higher escalation rate than the corpus average. Root causes: (1) customers arrive pre-frustrated due to ongoing outages (emotion_anger at Turn 1 averages 0.45 vs 0.12 baseline), (2) agents frequently cannot provide resolution timelines (discourse_denial=0.58), and (3) repeat callers reference unresolved prior interactions (repetition=0.72). The dominant causal path is: delay + repetition -> customer_anger -> escalation, with customer_anger mediating 78% of the total effect.",Task 1 initial query; tests identification of pre-existing emotional state as causal factor in Telecommunications domain.
Q010,How does the causal chain differ when the outage is caused by a network-wide event versus an individual account issue?,Follow-up Reasoning,"For network-wide outages (Business Event - Network Outage intent), the delay variable dominates because agents cannot offer individual fixes, leading to: delay -> customer_anger -> escalation (ATE of delay=0.52). For individual account issues (Service Interruptions intent), the agent_response_quality variable is more influential: agent_response_quality -> resolution_time -> escalation (ATE of quality=0.39). Network outage calls also show higher discourse_denial scores (0.71 vs 0.43) as agents lack authority to resolve systemic issues.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 9; tests ability to differentiate causal mechanisms across sub-intents within the same domain.
Q011,"For those network outage calls, what counterfactual intervention would most reduce escalations?",Counterfactual Reasoning,"Intervening on agent_response_quality (do(agent_response_quality=0.9)) reduces estimated escalation from 0.74 to 0.38, even when delay remains high. This is because high-quality responses—providing specific ETAs, proactive status updates, and service credits—mitigate the delay -> anger pathway. In contrast, intervening on delay alone (do(delay=0)) only reduces escalation to 0.51, since customer anger from prior outage experience persists. The most effective intervention combines both: do(delay=0, quality=0.9) reduces escalation to 0.18.",Task 2 follow-up to Queries 9-10; tests multi-variable counterfactual with accumulated context from two prior turns.
Q012,What dialogue-level factors in insurance calls lead customers to threaten legal action?,Causal Explanation,"Legal-action threats in insurance calls are driven by a three-stage causal cascade: (1) claim denial or partial coverage disclosure (discourse_denial, Turns 3-5), (2) perceived lack of empathy in agent responses (low discourse_apology, Turns 5-7), (3) customer anger surpassing a threshold (emotion_anger > 0.7, Turns 7-9). Evidence: Turn 5 (Agent): 'Unfortunately, that procedure is not covered under your current plan.' Turn 8 (Customer): 'This is unacceptable, I will be contacting my lawyer.' The ATE of discourse_denial on escalation is 0.47.",Task 1 initial query; tests identification of causal cascade in Insurance domain with Escalation - Threat of Legal Action intent.
Q013,Does the presence of an apology after the denial change the escalation outcome in those insurance calls?,Follow-up Reasoning,"Partially. When an apology follows within 1-2 turns of a denial (discourse_apology > 0.5 within Turns 4-6), escalation probability drops from 0.82 to 0.54. However, when the apology is delayed beyond 3 turns, it has no significant effect (escalation remains at 0.79). The causal model shows a time-sensitive interaction: early apology moderates the denial -> anger pathway, but late apology occurs after anger has already crossed the escalation threshold. Evidence from resolved calls: Turn 4 (Agent): 'I understand this is disappointing. Let me explain what options we do have.'",Task 2 follow-up to Query 12; tests temporal causal interaction and moderation effects with context dependency.
Q014,Why do calls involving multiple billing issues in banking have longer resolution times and higher escalation rates?,Causal Explanation,Multi-issue banking calls (intent: Multiple Issues - Billing & Payment Setup) average 22.3 turns versus 14.1 for single-issue calls. The additional complexity creates compounding frustration: each unresolved sub-issue increases customer_anger by approximately 0.15 points. The causal path is: repetition (across sub-issues) -> resolution_time -> customer_anger -> escalation. Agent_response_quality is a key confounder—calls where agents address issues sequentially with clear transitions show 40% lower escalation than those where agents attempt parallel resolution.,Task 1 initial query; tests causal analysis of multi-issue conversations in Banking & Finance domain.
Q015,Which specific sub-issue sequence tends to produce the worst outcomes in those multi-issue calls?,Follow-up Reasoning,"The sequence billing-dispute -> payment-setup -> account-access produces the highest escalation rate (0.68). This is because billing disputes prime customer anger (emotion_anger=0.52 after dispute discussion), and subsequent payment-setup complexity sustains frustration without resolution. In contrast, the sequence account-access -> billing -> payment produces lower escalation (0.31) because successful account access in the first stage builds agent credibility. Evidence: [Call 7034-5430, Turn 12] (Customer): 'You still haven't fixed the first problem and now this payment isn't going through either.'",Task 2 follow-up to Query 14; tests sequential pattern analysis with causal ordering effects.
Q016,"In technology support calls about software update failures, what agent behaviours causally reduce escalation?",Causal Explanation,"Three agent behaviours show significant negative causal effect on escalation: (1) Acknowledging the issue without deflection within the first 2 turns (reduces escalation by 0.22, p<0.01), (2) providing a specific workaround rather than asking the customer to 'wait for the next update' (reduces escalation by 0.31), (3) offering to stay on the line during the fix (discourse_promise > 0.6 at resolution turn, reduces escalation by 0.18). The causal chain for successful resolution: agent_response_quality -> -customer_anger -> -escalation.",Task 1 initial query; tests identification of protective (negative) causal factors in Technology Support domain.
Q017,Show me evidence from specific calls where the agent successfully prevented an escalation during an update-failure call.,Evidence Retrieval,"Successful de-escalation examples: [Call 3291-5075, Turn 4] (Agent): 'I can see the update failed on your device. Let me walk you through a manual fix right now—it should take about 5 minutes.' (discourse_promise=0.85, discourse_clarification=0.72). [Call 8531-3291, Turn 6] (Agent): 'I completely understand the frustration. While we work on a permanent patch, here is a workaround that our engineering team has verified.' (discourse_apology=0.68, agent_response_quality=0.91). Both calls resolved without escalation despite initial customer anger > 0.5.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 16; tests evidence retrieval with specific Call ID references (ID Recall metric).
Q018,What causal factors lead to escalation in travel reservation modification calls?,Causal Explanation,"In Travel & Hospitality reservation-modification calls, escalation is primarily caused by: (1) fee disclosure surprises (discourse_denial when customer expects free changes, ATE=0.38), (2) system limitations preventing the requested modification (discourse_delay while agent checks availability, ATE=0.29), and (3) prior negative experience references (repetition from previous stays, ATE=0.25). The causal DAG shows fee-surprise has the strongest direct effect: fee_disclosure -> customer_anger -> escalation, with no significant confounders.",Task 1 initial query; tests causal analysis in Travel & Hospitality domain with Reservation Modifications intent.
Q019,How do these reservation escalation patterns compare to the escalation patterns we discussed earlier in telecom service-interruption calls?,Cross-Domain Comparison,"Key differences: (1) Travel escalations are fee-driven (discourse_denial ATE=0.38) while telecom escalations are delay-driven (discourse_delay ATE=0.52). (2) Travel customers arrive with lower baseline anger (Turn 1 emotion_anger=0.15 vs 0.45 in telecom), so the escalation threshold requires a larger in-call anger increase. (3) Travel calls have a stronger apology-mitigation effect (apology reduces escalation by 0.28 in travel vs 0.12 in telecom), suggesting travel customers are more responsive to empathetic recovery. Common factor: repetition amplifies escalation in both domains.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 18 referencing Queries 9-11; tests cross-domain consistency and long-range context retention.
Q020,"During e-commerce system outages, how do conversation patterns change compared to normal call volume, and what causal impact does this have on outcomes?",Causal Explanation,"During Business Event - System Outage periods, e-commerce calls show: (1) 2.8x increase in discourse_complaint scores (0.71 vs 0.25 baseline), (2) agent discourse_delay increases by 1.9x (0.64 vs 0.34) due to system unavailability, (3) customer emotion_urgency spikes to 0.67 vs 0.22 baseline. The causal effect of outage-period on escalation is 0.58 (ATE), mediated primarily through delay -> customer_anger -> escalation. However, agents who proactively communicate outage status (discourse_promise > 0.7) reduce escalation by 35% even during outages.",Task 1 initial query; tests event-level causal analysis in E-commerce domain with Business Event intent.
Q021,Can you identify which specific agent communication strategies during outages were most effective at preventing escalation?,Follow-up Reasoning,"Three strategies ranked by causal effectiveness: (1) Upfront outage acknowledgment within Turn 2 (reduces escalation by 0.31): Evidence [Call 4606-3216, Turn 2] (Agent): 'I want to let you know we are currently experiencing a system-wide issue that our team is actively resolving.' (2) Providing specific ETA (reduces escalation by 0.24): [Call 5430-2980, Turn 5] (Agent): 'Our engineering team expects the system to be back online within 2 hours.' (3) Offering proactive compensation (reduces escalation by 0.19): [Call 2990-8975, Turn 7] (Agent): 'I am applying a 15% discount to your next order for the inconvenience.' Combined, these strategies reduce outage-period escalation from 0.74 to 0.29.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 20; tests identification of protective causal factors with Call ID evidence.
Q022,"In insurance claim-denial conversations, what is the causal relationship between the way the denial is communicated and the customer's subsequent behaviour?",Causal Explanation,"The communication style of denial is causally linked to outcomes through two pathways: (1) Direct denial without explanation (discourse_denial > 0.8, discourse_clarification < 0.2) leads to: denial -> customer_anger (ATE=0.56) -> escalation. (2) Denial with detailed rationale (discourse_denial > 0.8, discourse_clarification > 0.6) leads to: denial -> moderate_anger (ATE=0.29) -> complaint (but not escalation). Evidence: Unexplained denial [Turn 4] (Agent): 'That claim has been denied.' vs Explained denial [Turn 4] (Agent): 'The claim was denied because the treatment is classified as elective under Section 4.2 of your policy. Let me explain your appeal options.'",Task 1 initial query; tests interaction effects between discourse variables in Insurance Claim Denials.
Q023,"For those claim-denial calls that did escalate, what was the most common point in the conversation where the trajectory became irreversible?",Follow-up Reasoning,"Analysis of escalated claim-denial calls shows a 'point of no return' typically occurs between Turns 6-8, characterised by: customer_anger exceeding 0.75, at least one discourse_escalation_request keyword ('supervisor', 'manager'), and agent discourse_denial remaining high without compensating discourse_promise. Before this point, intervention (apology + alternative options) successfully prevents escalation in 62% of cases. After this point, only 11% of calls are de-escalated. The critical transition is: sustained denial (3+ consecutive agent turns with denial > 0.5) -> anger threshold breach -> escalation request.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 22; tests temporal tipping-point analysis with causal threshold identification.
Q024,"Across all domains in the dataset, what are the top three universal causal factors that predict escalation?",Causal Explanation,"Cross-domain analysis of 5,037 transcripts identifies three universal escalation predictors: (1) Agent response delay (discourse_delay): ATE=0.34, consistent across all 7 domains, strongest in Telecommunications (0.52) and weakest in E-commerce (0.24). (2) Customer repetition of complaint (repetition): ATE=0.31, indicating failure of prior resolution attempts, strongest in Healthcare (0.44). (3) Agent denial without alternative (discourse_denial - discourse_promise): ATE=0.28, representing dead-end responses. Together these three factors explain 73% of variance in escalation outcomes per the causal model.",Task 1 initial query; tests corpus-wide causal analysis across all seven dataset domains.
Q025,How do those three universal factors interact with each other? Is there a compounding effect?,Follow-up Reasoning,"Yes, significant interaction effects exist: (1) delay + repetition compound synergistically—their combined ATE (0.52) exceeds the sum of individual ATEs (0.34 + 0.31 = 0.65 expected additive, but 0.52 actual reflects overlap via the shared customer_anger mediator). (2) denial + delay show the strongest compounding: when both are high (> 0.6), escalation probability reaches 0.89, versus 0.41 for delay-only and 0.38 for denial-only. (3) denial + repetition is the most dangerous pair for legal-threat escalations specifically (probability 0.71). The causal DAG captures these interactions through the shared mediator customer_anger, which saturates when multiple causal inputs are active simultaneously.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 24; tests understanding of causal interaction and mediation effects.
Q026,What causal patterns distinguish healthcare escalations about medical errors from those about service failures?,Causal Explanation,"Medical-error complaints (Escalation - Medical Error Complaint) differ from service-failure escalations in three ways: (1) Customer anger starts significantly higher at Turn 1 (emotion_anger=0.62 vs 0.28 for service failures), reflecting pre-call distress. (2) The dominant causal path differs: medical errors follow customer_anger -> escalation directly (ATE=0.61), while service failures follow repetition -> customer_anger -> escalation (ATE=0.44). (3) Agent discourse_clarification has opposite effects: it reduces escalation in service failures (ATE=-0.22) but has no significant effect in medical errors (ATE=-0.03), suggesting medical-error customers seek accountability rather than explanation.",Task 1 initial query; tests within-domain sub-intent comparison in Healthcare Services.
Q027,"Given that clarification doesn't help in medical-error calls, what agent behaviour does reduce escalation in those cases?",Follow-up Reasoning,"For medical-error complaint calls, the most effective agent behaviours are: (1) Explicit acknowledgment of the error without deflection (discourse_promise with accountability language, ATE=-0.33): Evidence [Turn 5] (Agent): 'I can see that an error occurred in your records, and I take full responsibility for ensuring this is corrected.' (2) Immediate concrete action steps (discourse_promise > 0.8, ATE=-0.29): [Turn 6] (Agent): 'I am filing a formal correction right now and will have a supervisor review your case by end of day.' (3) Offering direct supervisor contact proactively before the customer requests it (ATE=-0.21). Notably, apologies alone (discourse_apology without action) are ineffective (ATE=-0.04, p=0.42).",Task 2 follow-up to Query 26; tests identification of domain-specific protective factors with evidence.
Q028,How do customer conversations during a data-breach business event differ causally from those during a normal cyber-attack report?,Causal Explanation,"Data-breach response calls (Business Event - Data Breach Response) versus cyber-attack calls (Business Event - Cyber Attack) show distinct causal structures: (1) Data-breach calls have higher emotion_urgency (0.78 vs 0.54) because personal data is at risk. (2) The causal effect of agent delay on escalation is 2.1x stronger in data-breach calls (ATE=0.61 vs 0.29), since customers perceive delay as continued exposure to risk. (3) Data-breach calls uniquely show discourse_escalation_request correlating with requests for security guarantees rather than supervisor access. The dominant path in breach calls is: urgency + delay -> customer_anger -> escalation.",Task 1 initial query; tests causal comparison between related business-event intents in Technology Support domain.
Q029,What counterfactual intervention would be most effective across all the escalation scenarios we have discussed?,Counterfactual Reasoning,"Synthesising counterfactual analyses from Queries 3, 11, and the current context: the single most effective universal intervention is improving agent_response_quality (do(agent_response_quality=0.9)). This reduces escalation by an average of 0.35 across all domains, compared to 0.28 for eliminating delay and 0.22 for eliminating repetition. However, the optimal intervention varies by domain: Healthcare benefits most from accountability (ATE reduction=0.41), Telecommunications from delay reduction (0.38), Insurance from early empathy (0.36), and Banking from process efficiency (0.33). A one-size-fits-all approach sacrifices 15-20% effectiveness compared to domain-specific interventions.","Task 2 follow-up referencing multiple prior query chains (Queries 3, 11, 26-27); tests long-range multi-turn context synthesis."
Q030,Why do unauthorized account-closure calls in banking have the highest escalation rate across all intents?,Causal Explanation,"Unauthorized account-closure calls (Escalation - Unauthorized Account Closure) have an escalation rate of 0.91, the highest across all 41 intents. Causal analysis reveals a unique triple-pathway activation: (1) immediate high anger due to loss of financial access (emotion_anger at Turn 1 = 0.81), (2) agent inability to reverse closures in real-time (discourse_denial = 0.89, discourse_delay = 0.76), and (3) customer perception of negligence triggering legal-threat language (discourse_escalation_request = 0.84). Unlike other escalation types, the anger -> escalation path is not mediated—customers escalate immediately upon learning the account cannot be instantly restored.",Task 1 initial query; tests analysis of extreme-case outcomes with non-mediated causal pathways in Banking domain.
Q031,Are there any unauthorized account-closure calls that did not escalate? What was different about them?,Follow-up Reasoning,"Of 47 unauthorized account-closure calls, only 4 (8.5%) did not escalate. These share three distinguishing features: (1) The agent confirmed the closure was an error within the first 3 turns (discourse_clarification > 0.8 by Turn 3), eliminating the denial pathway. (2) The agent initiated account restoration immediately (discourse_promise > 0.9, Turn 4-5) rather than quoting processing times. (3) In 3 of 4 cases, the agent proactively offered compensation without being asked. Evidence: [Call 8660-4606, Turn 3] (Agent): 'I can see this closure was made in error. I am reopening your account right now and all your funds are intact.' The key causal difference: early certainty (agent_response_quality > 0.85 by Turn 3) prevents the anger -> escalation pathway from activating.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 30; tests outlier analysis within an extreme-case intent with Call ID evidence.
Q032,How do product-recall conversations in e-commerce differ from regular delivery investigations in terms of causal drivers of negative outcomes?,Causal Explanation,"Product-recall calls (Business Event - Product Recall) versus delivery investigations show fundamentally different causal structures. Recall calls: safety concern drives urgency (emotion_urgency=0.72), and the dominant path is urgency -> customer_anger -> complaint/escalation. Agent discourse_clarification about recall scope is critical (ATE=-0.34). Delivery investigations: frustration drives the process, with delay -> repetition -> customer_anger -> escalation as the dominant chain. Key difference: recall customers respond positively to information (clarification reduces anger), while delivery customers respond to action (replacement/refund reduces anger).",Task 1 initial query; tests within-domain comparison of business-event versus operational intents.
Q033,"Based on all our analysis, which domain-intent combination has the most preventable escalations?",Follow-up Reasoning,"Ranking by preventability (defined as escalation rate × intervention effectiveness): (1) Telecommunications - Service Interruptions (preventability score=0.42): high escalation rate (0.67) with strong agent_response_quality intervention effect (-0.35). (2) E-commerce - Delivery Investigation (0.38): moderate escalation (0.45) but highly responsive to early replacement offers (-0.41). (3) Insurance - Claim Denials (0.35): high escalation (0.72) but partial mitigation through explained denial (-0.28). Least preventable: Banking - Unauthorized Account Closure (0.08): extremely high escalation (0.91) with limited intervention effectiveness due to systemic constraints. This ranking synthesises causal effect estimates from Queries 7, 9, 12, 22, and 30.",Task 2 follow-up synthesising all prior analyses; tests comprehensive multi-turn context integration across the full conversation history.
Q034,What causal factors in legal contract-dispute calls lead to the customer retaining external counsel instead of accepting the proposed settlement?,Causal Explanation,"Customers retain external counsel when: (1) the agent uses ambiguous contractual language without citing specific clauses (discourse_clarification < 0.3, ATE=0.44), (2) settlement offers are perceived as significantly below the disputed amount (discourse_denial of full claim, ATE=0.39), and (3) the agent fails to acknowledge the customer's legal framing of the issue (discourse_apology < 0.1, ATE=0.27). The causal chain is: ambiguity + perceived_unfairness -> customer_distrust -> external_counsel_retention. Evidence: Turn 6 (Customer): 'Your terms are unclear and I need my attorney to review this.'",Task 1 initial query; tests causal reasoning in Legal domain with contract-dispute intent.
Q035,"In those legal disputes, does providing a line-by-line contract walkthrough reduce the likelihood of counsel retention?",Follow-up Reasoning,"Yes. When agents provide a clause-by-clause walkthrough (discourse_clarification > 0.7 within Turns 3-6), the probability of external counsel retention drops from 0.71 to 0.34. The mechanism is: detailed clarification reduces perceived ambiguity, breaking the ambiguity -> distrust pathway. However, this effect is moderated by dispute amount—for claims exceeding $50,000, clarification alone is insufficient (retention remains at 0.58) because financial stakes independently drive legal escalation. Evidence: [Call 6120-4409, Turn 5] (Agent): 'Let me walk you through Section 3.2 which addresses your specific concern.'",Task 2 follow-up to Query 34; tests moderation by financial magnitude in Legal domain.
Q036,Why do university enrollment-dispute calls escalate more frequently when the student references financial-aid dependencies?,Causal Explanation,"Financial-aid references activate a compounding causal pathway: enrollment_error -> financial_aid_risk -> emotion_urgency (0.74) -> escalation. Students who mention aid dependencies show 2.4x higher escalation rates because unresolved enrollment errors threaten aid eligibility, housing, and visa status simultaneously. The agent's inability to provide cross-departmental resolution (discourse_delay=0.68 due to siloed systems) amplifies urgency. Evidence: Turn 4 (Student): 'If this isn't fixed today my financial aid gets revoked and I lose my housing.'",Task 1 initial query; tests multi-dependency causal chains in Education domain.
Q037,What counterfactual intervention in enrollment calls would most reduce escalation for students with financial-aid dependencies?,Counterfactual Reasoning,"Intervening with immediate cross-departmental conferencing (do(discourse_delay=0, cross_dept_access=1)) reduces escalation from 0.82 to 0.29. This is more effective than agent empathy alone (do(discourse_apology=0.9)) which only reduces escalation to 0.61, because the core driver is systemic urgency rather than emotional frustration. The optimal intervention combines: (1) real-time financial-aid hold placement to prevent automatic revocation, and (2) single-call resolution across registrar and aid offices.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 36; tests counterfactual with systemic intervention in Education domain.
Q038,What discourse patterns in clinical-trial adverse-event reporting calls predict whether the caller escalates to a regulatory complaint?,Causal Explanation,"Regulatory complaint escalation is driven by: (1) agent minimisation of reported symptoms (discourse_denial of severity, ATE=0.51), (2) failure to initiate mandatory reporting protocols within the call (discourse_delay > 0.6, ATE=0.43), and (3) caller perception that safety data is being suppressed (repeat requests for documentation, repetition=0.69). The causal chain is: minimisation + protocol_delay -> caller_distrust -> regulatory_complaint. Evidence: Turn 7 (Caller): 'I need confirmation that this event has been formally reported to the safety board.'",Task 1 initial query; tests causal reasoning in Science/pharmaceutical domain with regulatory compliance implications.
Q039,How do the reporting-call patterns differ when the adverse event is classified as serious versus non-serious?,Follow-up Reasoning,"Serious adverse events (SAEs) show fundamentally different dynamics: (1) caller emotion_urgency is 2.3x higher at Turn 1 (0.81 vs 0.35 for non-serious), (2) agents must follow expedited 24-hour reporting timelines, making discourse_delay impact 3.1x stronger (ATE=0.67 vs 0.22), (3) SAE callers are more likely to be healthcare professionals who demand protocol-specific language, so agent_response_quality has a stronger protective effect (ATE=-0.41 vs -0.18). Non-serious events escalate primarily through perceived dismissiveness rather than protocol urgency.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 38; tests severity-stratified causal analysis in Science domain.
Q040,What causal factors in HR grievance calls predict whether an employee files a formal complaint with an external labour board?,Causal Explanation,"External filing is predicted by a three-stage cascade: (1) perceived procedural injustice—employee feels the internal process is biased (discourse_denial of evidence review, ATE=0.47), (2) retaliation concerns—employee references fear of consequences for raising the issue (emotion_urgency=0.66, ATE=0.38), (3) lack of timeline commitment from HR (discourse_delay > 0.5, ATE=0.31). The dominant causal path is: procedural_injustice -> distrust -> external_filing. Evidence: Turn 8 (Employee): 'If this isn't taken seriously internally, I have no choice but to go to the labour board.'",Task 1 initial query; tests causal cascade in HR domain with grievance-handling intent.
Q041,Does assigning a neutral third-party investigator during the call change the external-filing outcome in those HR grievance cases?,Follow-up Reasoning,"Yes, significantly. When the HR representative offers a neutral investigator within the first 5 turns (discourse_promise with neutrality language > 0.7), external filing probability drops from 0.68 to 0.27. The mechanism is: third-party assignment directly addresses the procedural_injustice -> distrust pathway by signalling impartiality. However, this intervention is ineffective when offered after Turn 8 (probability remains at 0.62), suggesting that distrust crystallises early. Evidence: [Call 7721-3305, Turn 4] (HR): 'I am assigning an independent investigator from outside your department to review this matter.'",Task 2 follow-up to Query 40; tests temporal sensitivity of intervention in HR domain.
Q042,What causal factors in marketing campaign-performance dispute calls lead clients to terminate their agency contract?,Causal Explanation,"Contract termination is driven by: (1) inability to attribute ROI to specific campaign actions (discourse_clarification < 0.3 on metrics questions, ATE=0.42), (2) repeated missed KPI targets referenced across multiple calls (repetition=0.71, ATE=0.38), (3) agent deflection to external market factors without acknowledging agency responsibility (discourse_denial of accountability, ATE=0.35). The causal chain is: attribution_failure + repeated_misses -> client_distrust -> contract_termination. Evidence: Turn 5 (Client): 'You keep blaming the algorithm but I need to see what your team actually did differently.'",Task 1 initial query; tests causal reasoning in Marketing domain with performance-dispute intent.
Q043,How do those marketing dispute patterns compare to the insurance claim-denial patterns we analysed earlier?,Cross-Domain Comparison,"Key parallels and differences: (1) Both domains show discourse_denial as a primary escalation driver (ATE=0.35 in marketing vs 0.47 in insurance), but the denial targets differ—marketing denies accountability while insurance denies coverage. (2) Marketing clients respond more strongly to data-driven clarification (ATE=-0.38) than insurance customers (ATE=-0.22), because marketing disputes are inherently metrics-based. (3) The temporal tipping point is earlier in marketing (Turns 4-5) versus insurance (Turns 6-8), reflecting shorter client patience in commercial relationships. Common factor: in both domains, denial without alternatives accelerates negative outcomes.",Task 2 follow-up to Query 42 referencing Queries 22-23; tests cross-domain comparison between Marketing and Insurance.
